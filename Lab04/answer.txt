Q:When overriding the equals() method of the Object class, you will have to cast the Object parameter obj to the type of Object that you are dealing with.
 For example, in the Media class, you must cast the Object obj to a Media, and then check the equality of the two objectsâ€™ 
attributes as the above requirements (i.e. title for Media; title and length for Track). If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens? 

A:The equals() method will return false as if an object is not an instance of Media, it will not pass through if-else loop to get to return true, 
the method equals() returns false if object cannot get pass if-condition.
