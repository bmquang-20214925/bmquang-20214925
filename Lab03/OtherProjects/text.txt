Files.readAllBytes reads all the bytes from the specified file as a byte array. It does not differentiate between the types of files, so you can use it to read bytes from any type of file, including both .txt and .exe files. In the code you provided, the Files.readAllBytes method is used to read all the bytes from the file text.exe into a byte array named inputBytes. Then, the code converts each byte to a char and concatenates them into a String named outputString. Finally, the code prints the time taken to perform the conversion to the console. So in this case, the code is reading bytes from an .exe file, but you can use the same method to read bytes from any other type of file as well.
